= Munkey

Uses git to mirror an ftp server and track local changes. These can then be
pushed back up to the ftp server or additional changes pulled down from the
ftp server.

Solves my problem of working on a website locally but needing to interact
with other developers editing directly the server via ftp.

This is not very efficient yet since it downloads all the (non-.gitignore'd) 
files each time.

Note: Depends on net-ftp-list gem so be sure to install that as well

== Usage

munkey clone [--ignore=ignoresfile] ftp://usr:pwd@host/dir [dst]

munkey pull [--no-merge] [--full-download] - pulls in new changes from ftp

munkey push - pushes changes back into ftp server. Important to have pulled
              recent changes from ftp since munkey will overwrite locally
              modified files.

== Caveats

* Gitignore support doesn't understand inverse (!...) lines -- patches welcome
* Probably doesn't work on Windows (or any non-unix platform)
